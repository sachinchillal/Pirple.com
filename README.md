Recreate their Homepage

Using HTML, CSS and public-domain images, recreate their homepage from scratch. Write all the HTML and the CSS yourself. (Please do not copy any of the source from that site). If the page has images, you can use any images you find around the web (they don't have to match the originals exactly). Once you're done, your page should look as close to the original homepage as possible.

My Choice: **F. StackOverflow**
